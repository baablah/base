# Wha?

Websites show fixed content or run algorithms to show fixed content that works best for their advertisers.

Sometimes both.

# OK sure, but still, wha?

This website lets you edit the content so that you choose how you see it. 

The original content is still there and other can still see it.

You can see your version and share that view with whoever you want.

# Why?

Cos you think it would be good for you to replace President Trump with Junior Fart.

## Is that it?

Messing with the content is one thing. The other part is that you can choose which content to see and the order you see it. 

## Algorithms guess what you want?

No - everything is transparent and under your control. No hidden algorithms. 

You have simple choices:
- time ordered: newest first or oldest first
- people ordered: favourites first, most recently followed, the rest, or you choose.

That's it.
 
## AI supervision or creation?

No - we will never allow AI to supervise or create content. 

That's on you!
