# BaaBlah 🐑

See the world as you wish it. Let others see it that way too

# Wha?

Websites show fixed content or run algorithms to show fixed content that works best for their advertisers.

Sometimes both.

# OK sure, but still, wha?

BaaBlah lets you edit some or all the content so that you choose how you see it. 🫣

The original content is still there and others can still see it. 👀

You can see your version and share that view with whoever you want. 👀 🙈 🫣

# Why?

Cos, for example, you think it would be fun to replace the words President Trump with President Sanders or pictures of P Diddy with pictures of Snoopy.

## Is that it?

Messing with the content is one thing. 

The other part is that you can choose which content to see and the order you - and others - see it.

## Who knows what I changed?

All changes are evident. The original is always accessible. This is not deep fake network!

## Can the original content creator see what I did?

Yes. All changes are evident. 

They can also choose to change their content to match yours. 

The old and original versions are always still accessible.

## Algorithms guess what you want?

No. The timeline is transparent and under your control. No hidden algorithms. 

You have simple choices:
- time ordered: newest first or oldest first
- people ordered: favourites first, most recently followed, the rest, or you choose.

That's it.
 
## AI supervision or creation?

No. No AI to supervise or create content. 

That's on you!

## Surveillance for personalised adverts?

No. No surveillance. No personalised adverts.

No sharing personal data or profiles or surveilled behaviour.

## How can we trust you?

This is a thought experiment now so let's see if it works. 

Once we have 10 users, we will stop sign-ups and set up a proper body with authority to ensure that we keep our promises.
